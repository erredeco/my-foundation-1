<h2 id="stop-numero-3">Keystrokes</h2>
<h3 class="subheader">If you have keyboard affordances, you might need to explain them to users. For example, to quit your browser hit <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd>. (Don't actually type that now - there are more docs to read.) Keystroke is Foundation's simple character affordance tool.</h3>
<p>Sample with paragraph: to quit your browser hit <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd>. Funny? Not so much, I prefer reading Deadpool</p>
